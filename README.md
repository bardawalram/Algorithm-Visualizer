# Algorithm-Visualizer
An interactive web-based platform that visually demonstrates how popular algorithms work step-by-step.
The project aims to make learning algorithms intuitive and engaging through dynamic visualizations, animations, and complexity insights.
---
# ðŸš€ Overview
The Algorithm Visualizer provides a graphical representation of various algorithms, such as:

- Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search
 
- Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort (extendable to Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
  
 - It helps students and beginners:
   
      - Understand how algorithms manipulate data internally

      - Observe time complexity differences visually
 
      - Control and interact with the process (speed, pause/resume, reset)
